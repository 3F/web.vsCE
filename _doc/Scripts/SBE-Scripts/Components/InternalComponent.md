# InternalComponent

All internal operations with vsCommandEvent.

This component has some differences from original [vsSolutionBuildEvent](http://vssbe.r-eg.net/doc/Scripts/SBE-Scripts/Components/InternalComponent/)

## Entry point for component

The vsCommandEvent requires other name for all operations with InternalComponent:

* `vsCE` or alias `Core`

Samples:

```java
#[vsCE ...]
```

```java
#[Core ...]
```
